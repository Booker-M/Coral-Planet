# Coral Planet

### Booker Martin, Elena Martinez, Moriah Scott, Teresa Ueunten

## Pitch

Step into the center of the world where a variety of beautiful sea creatures roam around the planet's core. The serene core is covered with coral and groovy sea kelp and surrounded by bubbles. However, there is one ghastly problem! The humans have nefariously polluted this planet, carelessly dumping their waste into its oceans! The ocean may be a part of our world but to them, it's their entire universe. Imagine looking up at the sky one night to find toxic trash instead of stars, because this is the fate we have inflicted on this planet. So, it's up to you as a deep-sea diver to help clean our oceans and save these creatures' lives before it's too late! Are you up for the challenge?
